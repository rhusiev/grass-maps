# Grass Maps

Grass Maps is an Android app for offline maps, routing and navigation. Kotlin
and Compose build the UI. A Rust core will hold search, analysis and region
data. MapLibre Native sits behind our own map interface, so the map binding
stays a one-module swap.

This repository holds the milestone-0 skeleton: the Gradle build, the module
layout, the plugin boundary rule, the command bus, and the plugin host. No
product feature is implemented yet.

## Build

Requirements: JDK 21 and an Android SDK with platform 37.

```sh
export JAVA_HOME=$HOME/dotfiles/local/share/jdk
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

Create an untracked `local.properties` with the absolute SDK path before the
first build:

```properties
sdk.dir=/home/you/.local/share/android-sdk
```

The build uses Gradle 9.3.1, AGP 9.1.0 with built-in Kotlin, compileSdk 37,
targetSdk 36 and minSdk 29.

## Checks

`./check.sh` is the gate every agent and the orchestrator runs before merging.
On this machine it re-executes itself under the `gm-build` slot, so Gradle
never runs outside the slot:

```sh
./check.sh                 # everything below, including reproducibility
./check.sh --skip-repro    # the fast loop; CI runs reproducibility separately
```

It runs Spotless with ktlint from the root, Android lint,
`:app:assembleDebug`, the JVM unit tests, `checkPluginBoundaries`,
`checkPluginManifests`, and two unsigned release builds at different paths
compared byte for byte. The test count is reported; an empty suite fails the
gate, so deleting the last test cannot pass CI.

`checkPluginBoundaries` enforces the plugin module dependency rule.
`checkPluginManifests` validates every `src/main/plugin.json`: unique plugin
ids, namespaced command and stream ids, command implementations, setting
defaults and scopes, dispatch policies, and stream serializers. Plugin modules
wire both checks into `check`.

```sh
./scripts/ci/android-smoke.sh app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

The device check installs and launches the debug APK and fails on a crash or
on a StrictMode policy violation. CI runs it on an API 29 x86_64 emulator.
Debug builds install the policy through `DebugApplication`, which extends the
main `GrassMapsApplication` and is also the marker the script requires, so an
APK without the policy cannot pass by staying silent.

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push and pull
request. Format, lint, build, unit tests, boundaries and manifest lint are one
fast job; reproducibility and the API 29 emulator run as separate jobs. The
iOS compile job is named as pending until an iOS or Kotlin Multiplatform target
exists, and its summary says that it verified nothing.

## Module map

Each namespace is `nl.r1a.grassmap.<module>`, with dots in place of hyphens in
the module name. Only `app` is an application module; its application ID is
`nl.r1a.grassmap`.

| Module | Owns | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| `plugin-api` | base types, domain value types, host interfaces, service contracts, capability contracts, manifest schema, contract versions | Kotlin stdlib, coroutines, serialization |
| `plugin-ui-api` | Compose UI contracts for compiled-in UI plugins | `plugin-api` |
| `core` | command bus, plugin host, stream registry, capability registry, lifecycle, undo/redo stacks | `plugin-api` |
| `core-services` | settings and profiles, storage, location, network gate, i18n, clock, logging | `core`, `plugin-api` |
| `map` | the `MapHost` implementation, style composer, layer slots, gestures, camera, location puck | `plugin-api` |
| `regions` | catalogue, download, verify, mount, update, source resolver, routing pack handling | `plugin-api` |
| `routing` | engine host, request builder, route model assembly | `plugin-api` |
| `navigation` | route follower, off-route detection, reroute policy, guidance | `routing`, `plugin-api` |
| `alerts` | alert sources, scheduling, sound, vibration and banner output | `navigation`, `plugin-api` |
| `places` | place and search provider hosts, favourites store | `plugin-api` |
| `tracks` | GPX import and export, track store, analysis engine | `plugin-api` |
| `ui-shell` | screens, bottom bar and sheet, configurable button and widget grid, command palette, theme, strings | `plugin-api`, `plugin-ui-api` |
| `control` | JSON-RPC control channel and MCP server, peer auth, allowlist, privacy switch | `core`, `plugin-api` |
| `devtools` | debug harness: benchmark hooks, GPX replay, screenshot and state probes | `core`, `control`, `plugin-api` |
| `app` | composition root, Android entry points, foreground service, manifest, resources | every module |
| `plugins/example` | example of a first-party plugin module | `plugin-api` |

## Plugin boundary rule

A module under `plugins/` may depend on `:plugin-api`. It may also depend on
`:plugin-ui-api` when it contributes Compose UI. No other project dependency is
allowed in any configuration.

`./gradlew checkPluginBoundaries` checks every module under `plugins/` and
fails with each violating module, configuration and dependency. Plugin modules
wire this task into `check`.

Feature modules never import `core` or `core-services`. They take the host and
service interfaces they need in their constructors, and `app` wires the
implementations. The only feature-to-feature edges are `navigation -> routing`
and `alerts -> navigation`.

## Plugin manifests

Every module under `plugins/` carries `src/main/plugin.json`. At build time the
`generatePluginRegistry` task reads those manifests and writes
`GeneratedPlugins.kt` and `GeneratedStreams.kt` into `app`, so the host never
scans the classpath or uses reflection.

A manifest declares the plugin id, version, the `plugin-api` version, the
implementation class, and its contributions: commands with parameter and result
schemas, their dispatch policy (undoable, required switch, control allowlist and
dispatcher), providers with contract versions and static capabilities, streams
with a value type and serializer, and settings with defaults and scopes. The host
rejects a command whose code policy disagrees with its manifest. The example
plugin declares one command, one stream and one provider.

`checkPluginManifests` fails the build when a manifest breaks the rules above,
including a declared command whose implementation class is missing from the
plugin's source or a policy field the generator does not understand. Each plugin
module's `check` and `app:check` depend on it.

## Follow-ups

`plugin-api` and `plugin-ui-api` are ordinary Android libraries in this
skeleton. Moving them to Kotlin Multiplatform source sets is a follow-up, so
their contracts stay free of Android types now.

CI, `docs/`, the control channel and the benchmarks belong to the later
milestone-0 tasks from T-0012 onward.
